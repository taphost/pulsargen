# Pulsar B1919+21

An animated visualization of the famous pulsar B1919+21 radio signal data, inspired by the iconic graphic discovered at Jodrell Bank Observatory.

## Description

This project recreates the characteristic wave patterns of pulsar B1919+21, the first radio pulsar ever discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967. The visualization features procedurally generated waves with dynamic peaks and valleys, creating a mesmerizing display reminiscent of the original astronomical data plot.

## Features

- **Real-time procedural animation** with randomly generated wave patterns
- **Pause/Play** control to freeze and resume animation
- **Regenerate** button to create new random patterns
- **Save as PNG** to export the current frame as an image
- **Export HTML code** - copy to clipboard or download as file
- **Fully responsive** design for mobile and desktop
- **Zero dependencies** - pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Usage

Simply open the `pulsar-b1919+21.html` file in any modern web browser.

### Controls

- **Pause/Play Button**: Freeze or resume the animation
